        <h1>Murach's HTML5 and CSS3 (3rd Edition)</h1>
        <h2>Book Description</h2>
        <p id="paragraphDesc">With this book, you can teach yourself how to design web pages the way the professionals do,
            by using HTML and CSS in tandem to structure and format the page content. It begins with a 
            crash course that teaches you more about HTML  and CSS than you can learn from most full 
            books. That includes a chapter on Responsive Web Design that shows you how to build 
            responsive websites that will look and work right on all devices, from phones to tablets to 
            desktop computers.        
        </p>
        <p class="hide">
            After that, this book shows you how to enhance your web pages with features like images, 
            forms with built-in data validation, and audio and video clips.  You'll also learn how to use JavaScript and jQuery to 
            add features like image rollovers, image swaps, and slide shows. You'll learn how to use jQuery UI and  jQuery plugins to 
            add features like accordions, tabs, carousels, and slide shows.  And you'll learn how to use jQuery Mobile to develop 
            separate websites for mobile  devices.
